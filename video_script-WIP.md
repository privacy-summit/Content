# Video Script

<h3>Below is proposed script for promotional/landing page video</h3>

We stand on a precipice. Technology is leveraging what it is to be human, affording us with avenues of creation, development, and empowerment that will define who, and what, we are to become. 

Technology will determine how we develop; as individuals, as communities, as societies - as humans.

Harnessing technology for social good and guarding against public harm lies at the centre of our struggle.

In the last few years the concept of privacy has sat alongside us on this precipice. We now understand how data streams are a mirror onto our lives. A footprint of our digital existence. A lens all too focused on our behaviours both inside and outside of the digital realm. 

We now know how data is gathered; monitored, analysed, and then sold. We now understand how it is used to track, surveil, target, and even manipulate. We now perceive how certain entities profile us - our behaviours, our wants, our needs, our desires - the basic determinants of who were are as people. 

Creating a world that protects us from specific privacy related harms while respecting the privacy rights set out in the UN Charter for Human Rights (article 7) and the EU Charter for Fundamental Rights (article 12) is fundamental to achieving a fairer, open, and safer world. 

The Privacy Series wishes to inclusively and transparently determine the future for privacy related cryptocurrency regulation and legislation. 

The initiative seeks to bring social worlds together to communicate. Share knowledge, ideas and perspectives in a respectful manner - determining the future for how cryptocurrencies and digital cash can shape our world. 

Open, honest and informed discussion is the only way in which the world can create an empowering future that is fairer for everybody. 

A future where financial systems help, not hinder; protect not harm. 

The Privacy Series wants to offer practical solutions to some of the direct and consequential harms that may emerge in the brave, open and permissionless financial world being created through distributed ledger technology. 

Privacy matters, to all.

Let us not forget that as we build our financial future, together.
