# Video Script

<h3>Below is proposed script for promotional/landing page video</h3>

We stand at the precipice. Technology is leveraging what it is to be human, affording us with avenues of creation, development and empowerment that will define what we are to become.

Technology will define us; as individuals, as communities, as societies - as humans.

Harnessing technology for public good, while guarding against public harm lies at the very centre of our struggle.

In the last few years the concept of privacy has sat alongside us on this precipice. We now understand how data streams are a mirror onto our lives. A footprint of our digital existence. A lens all too focused on both the inside and the outside of our personal digital realm.

We now know how data is gathered; monitored, analysed, and then sold. We now understand how it is used to track, surveil, target and manipulate. We now perceive how certain entities profile us - our behaviours, our wants, our needs, our desires - the basic determinants of who we are.

The Privacy Series wishes to transparently determine the future for privacy related cryptocurrency legislation and regulation. It seeks to bring social worlds together to communicate knowledge, ideas, and perspectives - determining the future for how digital cash might shape our world for the better.

A future where financial systems help, not hinder; protect not harm.

Privacy matters, to all.

Let us not forget that as we build our financial future, together.
